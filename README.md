**Mental Health Treatment Prediction**
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person may need mental health treatment based on survey data.

**Overview**
The dataset includes features such as:
Age
Gender
Work Interference
Family History
Treatment History
Employer Support and other related factors
The goal of this project is to identify individuals who might require mental health treatment based on their responses.

**Algorithms Used**
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest (Best Accuracy: 75%)

**Key Results**
Accuracy: 75%
Precision: 75%
Recall: 75%
The Random Forest model provided the most balanced and accurate results among all tested algorithms.

**Insights**

The Random Forest model performed best overall.
Features such as family_history and work_interfere showed strong correlations with the likelihood of needing mental health treatment.

**Deploy the model using Flask and make it accessible as a web application**
